## Project Overview

The Skynet Proxy is designed to facilitate interactions with OpenAI's services, allowing dynamic retrieval, creation, routing, modification, and uploading of files. It adds the required "OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v1" header to requests sent from Skynet to the assistants API endpoints and dynamically changes the content type header for file upload functions based on the filename read in from the initial post request.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Skynet Proxy on your local environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for creating a public localhost tunnel

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skynet-proxy.git
   cd skynet-proxy
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

To configure the Skynet Proxy, follow these steps:

1. Configure ngrok to create a public localhost tunnel and set up your ngrok tunnel URL or domain if you are using pay-as-you-go.

2. Modify the proxy settings in the `config.js` file to specify your OpenAI API keys and other configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Skynet Proxy, follow these steps:

1. Start the proxy server:

   ```bash
   npm server.js
   ```
   
2. Start the NGROK tunnel:

   ```bash
   HTTP ngrok 3000
   ```

3. Make API requests to the Skynet Proxy, and it will interact with OpenAI's services as described in the project overview.

Detailed examples and usage guidelines can be found in the [Documentation](#documentation).
